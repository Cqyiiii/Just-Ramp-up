# Just Ramp-up: Unleash the Potential of Regression-based Estimator for A/B Tests under Network Interference





### Description

For every case described in the main paper, we create a specific iPython notebook for reproducing the result of simulation. 

In the following, we explain the what the abbreviations used in the file name corresponds to in the main paper:

- Ber: independent Bernoulli randomization

- CR: complete randomization

- cluster: cluster-level randomization

- unit: unit-level randomization

- 2step: merging two steps of experimental data, $(c_t,c_T)$ for increasing $t=1,2,...,T$.

- ramp: merging $(T-t+1)$ steps of experimental data, $(c_t,c_{t+1},\dots,c_T)$ for increasing $t=1,2,...,T$.

- repeat: merging $t$ pieces of experimental data generated by repeating treatment assignment with propensity $c_T$

- 2hop: 2-hop linear interference, as decribed in Section 5.5

- multiplicative: multiplicative potential outcome model, as decribed in Section 5.3

- dynamic: dynamic graph structure, as decribed in Section 5.6

- sqrt: square root interference, as decribed in Section 5.4

- square: quadratic interference, as decribed in Section 5.4

- ht: HT estimator

  



Since the Monte Carlo simulations demands for amount of operations on the original graph, we use the CPU version of GNN implemented by DGL. Thus, there is no need for CUDA.
